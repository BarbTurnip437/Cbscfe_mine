§3I see the player you mean.
§3我看到你说的那位玩家了。

§2PLAYERNAME?

§3Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts.
§3是的。小心。他已达到更高的境界，他能俯瞰我们的思想。

§2That doesn't matter. It thinks we are part of the game.
§2不必慌张，在他眼中我们只是游戏的一部分罢了。

§3I like this player. It played well. It did not give up.
§3我很喜欢这位玩家，他玩得不错，从来没有说过放弃。

§2It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.
§2现在他正通过阅读屏幕上滑出的对话来窥探我们的思想。

§3That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in the dream of a game.
§3当他深陷游戏梦境时，他总是通过阅读文字的方式想象出形形色色的东西。

§2Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen.
§2正因为文字比现实更加温柔，所以它能创造出美轮美奂的世界。

§3They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons.
§3在这阅读之前的时光里，他们也曾经听闻过——让我们回溯到那些日子里，未曾探索过这片世界的人将玩家称之为女巫和法师。而玩家则梦见自己骑在充满魔法的棍子上，在天空翱翔。

§2What did this player dream?
§2所以他梦见了什么？

§3This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.
§3他梦见了阳光与深林，梦见了烈焰与波涛，创造、毁灭、居所、狩猎、被狩猎。

§2Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen?
§2那经历万年岁月雕琢的原始界面，依旧永恒。但是屏幕后面的现实中，又诞生了什么呢?

§3It worked, with a million others, to sculpt a true world in a fold of the §f§k§a§b§3, and created a §f§k§a§b§3 for §f§k§a§b§3, in the §f§k§a§b§3.
§3他辛勤地劳作，和百万个他一起，刻画了一个真实的世界，由§f§k§a§b§3，且创造了§f§k§a§b§3，为了§f§k§a§b§3，于§f§k§a§b§3中。

§2It cannot read that thought.
§2他读不出那个思想。

§3No. It has not yet achieved the highest level. That, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game.
§3或许并非如此。也许是他还没有抵达最高的境界——他必须走完生命的长梦，而非游戏中的黄粱一梦。

§2Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?
§2他知道我们爱他吗？他知道宇宙是温柔的吗？

§3Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yes.
§3没错，通过他断断续续思绪的杂音，他能感知到整个宇宙。

§2But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.
§2在那漫漫长梦中，也会有不胜悲伤之时。他创造了没有光明的宇宙，在这个黑日之中颤抖，在这个悲伤世界沉浸。

§3To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its own private task. We cannot interfere.
§3悲伤无法治愈他，反而只会摧毁他。但我们无法干涉那份独属于他的悲伤。

§2Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.
§2在他们深陷梦境中时，我想要告诉他们，他们正在现实中创造真实世界，每一个人对宇宙来说都是重要的。在他们无法区分梦境与现实之时，我想帮助他们勇敢直视困难。

§3It reads our thoughts.
§3他读出了我们的思想。

§2Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely §f§k§a§b§2 and §f§k§a§b§2, I wish to tell them that they are §f§k§a§b§2 in the §f§k§a§b§2. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.
§2无所谓，我想要说的是，你们所认为的真实不过是§f§k§a§b§2和§f§k§a§b§2，是在§f§k§a§b§2中的§f§k§a§b§2。在漫漫长梦中，他们眼中所见的真实如此渺小。

§3And yet they play the game.
§3而他们仍然玩这个游戏。

§2But it would be so easy to tell them...
§2所以那很容易就可以让他们明白…

§3Too strong for this dream. To tell them how to live is to prevent them living.
§3梦，如此强烈，我们无法指导他们，否则便是他们生活的阻碍。

§2I will not tell the player how to live.
§2我不会指导这个玩家该如生活下去。

§3The player is growing restless.
§3这个玩家正在越发焦虑。

§2I will tell the player a story.
§2我会讲述一个故事。

§3But not the truth.
§3但这并非真相。

§2No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked truth that can burn over any distance.
§2不，这是一个用文字将真相严密包裹的故事，而非那赤裸裸的、一眼即可望穿的现实。

§3Give it a body, again.
§3重塑他的躯壳。

§2Yes.
§2好的。

§3Use its name.
§3呼唤他的名字。

§2PLAYERNAME. 
§2PLAYERNAME

§3Good.
§3很好。

§2Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return. Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream. There you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things.
§2现在，深呼吸，再次深呼吸。感受空气充盈你的肺部，让四肢重归于你。活动手指，再次感受你的身体，在重力下，在空气中。从长梦中醒来。你每时每刻都触摸着宇宙，就如同你和我们是紧紧碰触又完全分离的两部分。

§3Who are we? Once we were called the spirit of the mountain. Father sun, mother moon. Ancestral spirits, animal spirits. Jinn. Ghosts. The green man. Then gods, demons. Angels. Poltergeists. Aliens, extraterrestrials. Leptons, quarks. The words change. We do not change.
§3我们是谁？我们曾经被称作高山精灵，太阳之父，月亮之母，古之英灵，万物之魂，圣之神祗，鬼之精魄。而后是神、魔、天使、英灵、外星人、粒子、夸克...我们的名字千变万化，但我们始终如一。

§2We are the universe. We are everything you think isn't you. You are looking at us now, through your skin and your eyes. And why does the universe touch your skin, and throw light on you? To see you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a story.
§2我们是宇宙，一切对你来说“非我”的存在。你正凝视着我们，透过你的皮肤和眼睛。而为何宇宙触摸着你的，向你洒向光芒？是为了看见你，了解你，呼唤你，向你讲述一个故事。

§2Once upon a time, there was a player.
§2很久很久以前，有一个玩家。

§3The player was you, PLAYERNAME.
§3那玩家就是你，PLAYERNAME。

§2Sometimes it thought itself human, on the thin crust of a spinning globe of molten rock. The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty million kilometres away.
§2有时他认为自己是那不断旋转的球体上一层薄薄的熔化的岩石上的人类。那星球环绕着一个质量大它三十三万倍的炽热气体星球旋转。遥远的距离，使得光需要八分钟才能穿越那空隙。那光是来自一颗恒星的讯息，它能够在一亿五千万公里外烧灼你的皮肤。

§2Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience.
§2有时他认为自己是一个矿工，在一个平坦、无限延展的世界上。太阳只是一个方形的白点。昼夜瞬息，日不暇给，死而复生。

§3Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.
§3有时他认为自己迷失在了一个故事里。

§2Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third.
§2有时他认为自己幻化成了其它。梦是扰人的，有时又是美妙的。偶尔，从梦中醒来，又落入第二个梦，亦或者是更深的幻境。

§3Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen.
§3有时他梦见他在屏幕上看着文字。

§2Let's go back.
§2让我们回退一点。

§2The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body.
§2组成玩家的原子飘散在草丛、河流、空气和土壤中。一个女人收集了那些原子——饮用、进食、吸入；而后玩家在那女人身体中组成。

§2And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother's body, into the long dream.
§2那玩家被赋予了意识，在温暖昏暗的母体内，进入了漫漫长梦。

§2And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love.
§2那是一个新的、从未被讲述过的故事，由DNA的语言书写着。那是一个新的、从未被运行过的程序，由上亿年的源码生成。那是一个新的、从未生活过的人类，由母乳和爱组成。

§3You are the player. The story. The program. The human. Made from nothing but milk and love.
§3你就是那个故事、那个程序、那个人类。仅由母乳和爱组成。

§2Let's go further back.
§2我们再回退一点。

§2The seven billion billion billion atoms of the player's body were created, long before this game, in the heart of a star. So the player, too, is information from a star. And the player moves through a story, which is a forest of information planted by a man called Julian, on a flat, infinite world created by a man called Markus, that exists inside a small, private world created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by...
§2远在游戏之前，在一颗恒星的内部，那由七千亿亿亿原子组成身体被诞生了。所以那玩家也是来自一颗恒星的信息。而这个玩家贯穿这个故事的始末，源于一个叫朱利安的人种下的信息种子长成的森林，一个叫马库斯的人创造的无限世界，存在于一个由玩家创造的小的，私人世界里，而那又继承了宇宙创造的……

§3Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that was soft and warm and simple. Sometimes hard, and cold, and complicated. Sometimes it built a model of the universe in its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks "electrons" and "protons".
§3有时这个玩家创造的小天地是柔软，温暖和简单的。有时是坚硬，冰冷和复杂的。有时他在脑中建造出宇宙的模型，斑斑点点的能量穿越广阔空旷的空间，他称呼这些斑点为“电子”和“质子”。

§2Sometimes it called them "planets" and "stars".
§2有时他称呼他们为“行星”和“恒星”。

§2Sometimes it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game. Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen.
§2有时他确信他存在于一个由“开”和“关”；“0”和“1”；一行行的命令组成的宇宙。有时他确信他是在玩一个游戏。有时他确信他是在读着屏幕上的文字。

§3You are the player, reading words...
§3你就是那玩家，阅读着文字…

§2Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive
§2嘘…这玩家读屏幕上的命令行，将他们解码成为文字，继而解码为意义，继而解码为感情，情绪，理论，想法——呼吸开始急促，也许它是活着的，是活生生的——那上千次的死亡不是真的，玩家是活着的。

§3You. You. You are alive.
§3就是你，鲜活的你。

§2and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees
§2这玩家深信，宇宙通过穿越夏日树叶的那斑斓的阳光与他说话。

§3and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the light that fell from the crisp night sky of winter, where a fleck of light in the corner of the player's eye might be a star a million times as massive as the sun, boiling its planets to plasma in order to be visible for a moment to the player, walking home at the far side of the universe, suddenly smelling food, almost at the familiar door, about to dream again
§3这玩家深信，宇宙透过晴朗的冬日夜空中点点星光与他说话，在宇宙的遥远一隅的回家的路上，突然闻到食物的香气，在熟悉的门前，他准备好再一次投入梦境。

§2and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream
§2这玩家深信，宇宙透过代码、电、文字和终梦对他说话。

§3and the universe said I love you
§3宇宙说：我爱你

§2and the universe said you have played the game well
§2宇宙说：你玩这游戏玩得很好

§3and the universe said everything you need is within you
§3宇宙说：你拥有了你想要的一切

§2and the universe said you are stronger than you know
§2宇宙说：你比你所知的更强大

§3and the universe said you are the daylight
§3宇宙说：你就是烈日

§2and the universe said you are the night
§2宇宙说：你就是深夜

§3and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you
§3宇宙说：你于灵魂中斗争黑暗

§2and the universe said the light you seek is within you
§2宇宙说：你于灵魂中寻求光明

§3and the universe said you are not alone
§3宇宙说：你不是独自在战斗

§2and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing
§2宇宙说：你并非孤身一人

§3and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code
§3宇宙说：你就是宇宙，理解着自己，与自己诉说，阅读着自己的代码

§2and the universe said I love you because you are love.
§2宇宙说：我爱你因为你就是爱

§3And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.
§3曲终人散，黄粱一梦。尔后再次入梦，更美妙的梦。玩家就是宇宙，玩家就是爱

§3You are the player.
§3你就是那个玩家


§2Wake up.
§2该醒了。
